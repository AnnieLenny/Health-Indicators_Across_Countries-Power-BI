# Health Indicators & Life Expectancy Analysis in Power BI

In this project, I used Power BI to analyze various health indicators and their impact on life expectancy. The dataset used was cleaned, transformed, and visualized to extract valuable insights. Below is a step-by-step breakdown of the approach I followed.

## ðŸš€ Step-by-Step Approach:
## Data Sources: 

#Public health England 2015
https://data.london.gov.uk/download/public-health-outcomes-framework-indicators/c9070f6e-78f7-4552-a75e-d902f6febfce/phof-indicators-data-london-borough.xlsx


### 1. **Data Collection & Cleaning**
   - **Dataset Acquisition**: Obtained a dataset containing health indicators and life expectancy data for multiple countries.
   - **Data Cleaning**:
     - Removed inconsistencies, errors, and duplicate entries from the dataset.
     - Cleaned and ensured all data was in a consistent format.
     - Performed data transformation to handle missing values and correct any anomalies using the **Power Query Editor**.

### 2. **Data Transformation**
   - Transformed the dataset by creating new calculated columns to generate meaningful metrics, such as life expectancy differences by health indicators.
   - Aggregated the data to summarize key statistics like average life expectancy, average infant mortality rate, etc.

### 3. **Data Import & Relationships Setup**
   - Imported the cleaned and transformed data into Power BI using the "Get Data" option.
   - Created relationships between multiple tables to ensure data integrity and allow for effective analysis.
   - Defined **data hierarchies** to facilitate drill-downs and better insights into the data.

### 4. **Data Shaping with Power Query Editor**
   - Used the **Power Query Editor** to apply additional transformations such as grouping, filtering, and adding new columns.
   - Shaped the data to prepare it for analysis, including time-based hierarchies like years or regions.

### 5. **Creating Visuals**
   - Created a **table** to display the raw data for detailed inspection.
   - Selected **Bar Charts** and **Tree Maps** to represent health indicators and their impact on life expectancy.
     - **Bar Chart**: To show the comparison of life expectancy across countries and health indicators.
     - **Tree Map**: To visualize the distribution of various health factors and their correlation to life expectancy.
   - Dragged and dropped fields into the **canvas** to create interactive visuals for deeper exploration of the data.

### 6. **Customizing Visual Appearance**
   - Customized the appearance of the visuals by adjusting **legends**, **labels**, and **colors** for clarity and better presentation.
   - Applied a consistent color scheme and style to ensure the dashboard was easy to read and interpret.

### 7. **Enhancing Interactivity**
   - Added **Slicers** and **Filters** to allow users to interact with the data, filter by country, region, or health indicator, and drill deeper into specific insights.
   - Created an **interactive worksheet** where users could explore the relationships between life expectancy and various health factors like infant mortality, healthcare access, and chronic diseases.

### 8. **Second Canvas & Dashboard Design**
   - Designed a **second canvas** using a separate dataset to further analyze health indicators and their impact on life expectancy across different regions.
   - Combined the visuals into an engaging **dashboard** that presents a comprehensive view of the data and key findings.

### 9. **Publishing & Sharing**
   - Once the analysis and dashboard were finalized, I published the work to **Power BI Service** for sharing with stakeholders and other users.
   - The interactive dashboard is now accessible to explore and gain insights from the analysis of health indicators affecting life expectancy.

## ðŸ›  Tools & Techniques Used:
- **Power BI**: For data import, transformation, and visualization.
- **Power Query Editor**: For data cleaning, shaping, and transformation.
- **Slicers & Filters**: To enhance interactivity and user experience.
- **Calculated Columns**: To create new insights from the data.
- **Data Hierarchies**: For deeper drill-down analysis.

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Takeaways:
- This project showcases how health indicators like infant mortality, chronic diseases, and healthcare access influence life expectancy.
- Through data cleaning, transformation, and visualization in Power BI, I was able to provide actionable insights into how these factors vary across countries.
- The interactive dashboard allows users to explore these insights in a user-friendly way.

## ðŸ“… Future Improvements:
- Integrate additional data sources to further enrich the analysis (e.g., socioeconomic factors, environmental data).
- Add more advanced features like drill-through reports and dynamic filters for a more detailed exploration of the data.
- Update the dashboard regularly with real-time data for ongoing monitoring of health indicators and life expectancy.
